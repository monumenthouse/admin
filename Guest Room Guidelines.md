#For Hosts
The guest room exists to let Monument residents host friends and family for short visits. It is not a short-term sublet. If you are looking to discuss a sublet, please talk to @Geoff on [Slack](https://mnmt.slack.com).

###The Purpose of these Guidelines
This is a starting point, and an experiment. We expect to learn by hosting and to revise these guidelines accordingly. These guidelines are intended to make the guest room self-serve in most cases. This is intended to explain the standard setup. If the hosting situation you need is different than what's in the guidelines, you must get buy-in from other MNMT residents by alerting them of your situation via the mailing list or on #actives on [Slack](https://mnmt.slack.com). 

If you'd like to see a change to these guidelines, or if something doesn't make sense, please contact @Leslie on [Slack](https://mnmt.slack.com) OR start a discusion on #activies on [Slack](https://mnmt.slack.com) OR send a pull request to the [github repo](https://github.com/monumenthouse/admin). This is a living document and your contributions are welcome!

**How it works:** Add your guest's stay as *Your Name* hosts *Their Name* on the [Monument Guest Room calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=kfd48jdm1c3ftq857lela9sp6g%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles). Include their arrival and departure day and times (so that other people can book on those days if needed).

Optionally add details about them or their stay in the description section, and/or put a note in #activities on [Slack](https://mnmt.slack.com) (where the calendar events are being surfaced). It’s first come first serve, until we deem we need another system (some other houses setup an allotment of days, for example 10, that can be traded amongst housemates).  

**Your responsibilities:** Prepare and check the room ahead of time, read through the guest room instructions (below) with the guest, and leave the guest room ready for the next guest: launder all the bedding and towels and replace on the bed, and general cleaning of the space (sweep or vacuum). You are responsible for your guest. They should direct questions and needs towards you. If your guest is involved in any issue with other members of the house, it will be your responsibility to moderate the situation.
 
**Length of stay:** In order for this room to serve as a place for many people to swing by for a few days, and not as a crash pad for someone looking for temp housing, the stay limit is 7 days. If your guest stays for more than 7 days, they will be asked to leave, and you will need to discuss with house mates (and likely @Leslie) if you have the judgement to invite guests in the future.

**Who can stay:** Up to two guests can stay in the guest room at once under one host.

###Host FAQ
**I’m a member, but not a resident, can I host a guest?**
If you are a member and would like to host a guest in the guest room, you need to find a resident member, who will be in town at the same time as your guest, to vouch for your guest. This is in order to make sure that someone is around as the responsible party for your guest.

**What if my guest needs to extend their stay?**
If your guest needs to extend their stay beyond 7 days, they need to find another place to stay. Airbnb.com is an excellent resource. If they are staying for fewer than 7 days, and need to extend their stay to within 7 days, and there is no one else scheduled, then simply extend the calendar event so that everyone knows the room will be occupied.

**What if there’s something not covered in these guidelines?**
This is an evolving document. Please bring your issue to the attention of @Leslie and #activities on [Slack](https://mnmt.slack.com) well before your guest arrives and all reasonable effort will be made to sort it out. If the hosting situation you need is different than what's in the guidelines, you must get buy-in from other MNMT residents.

###The FUTURE
In the near-term, we want to be able to host guests comfortably, and start learning what works. But these Guidelines will also capture some of our ideas for potential future uses:
* AirBnB or paid guests: Eventually we may want to allow AirBnb guests (the average in the hood is $142/night), and it might be fun to have random visitors. At that time, someone will need to vet the guests and be their "host". When we do feel ready for that, it might make sense to only allow last minute bookings, so that house residents have first dibs with at least 2 or 4 weeks notice.
* Set limits on how many days any one host can offer: This is a common way to share guest room resources in other communal houses. And it's often setup like a currency, so you can trade or gift your days to other residents.
* Nonresidential members can offer the guest room freely: at some point (but lots to work out before we can do that), we might need to walk back the 7 day limit or otherwise put more limits on how much people get (but for now, we just want it to get used).
* Lofting the space for more guests: It's a skinny, but tall room, and a great candidate for a loft!
* Bunkbeds or other fun furniture: using a bunkbed or trundle bed could increase the number of folks who can stay in the room, if that's something we want.
* Futon instead of a bed: could make better use of the space, and help it to serve duel purposes as a meeting or chill space when not being used as a guest room.

#For Guests

**We’re excited to have you as our guest!**
Please feel free to use the kitchen and laundry room. The main floor bathrooms and sauna are also available for you to use. The guest room has linens and towels for you to use. You are invited to any and all of our events during your stay. We hope you have great conversations, make new friends, and enjoy your time with your host. If you have any issues, please speak with your host first. If they are unreachable for some reason please contact Leslie Chicoine at (415) 323-5998.

**Things we ask of you:**
Be respectful in regards to noise and cleanliness, wash your own dishes, leave the kitchen cleaner than you found it, keep your personal belongings in the guest room, and leave your used towels in the guest room when you leave. Your host will be in charge of laundry and cleaning after you depart.

Monument is a No smoking building. You may smoke on the second floor balcony (the outdoors one by the elevator), but never inside the building or any room, including the guest room. This includes tobacco, marijuana, and ecigs.

The common food is limited to snacks, you are welcome to peruse the panty, we generally ask that you give as much as you take, and review and follow the rules posted in the pantry. Please plan to supply your own meals if your host is not doing so.

Don't attempt to use any of the workshop spaces, equipment or gear without consulting with your host.


###Guest FAQ

**Can I smoke in the building?**
Absolutely not. This includes tobacco, marijuana, and ecigs. If you smoke you will be asked to leave. You may smoke on the second floor balcony, but you may need to ask your host for access. Please plan accordingly.

**Can I bring my pet with me?**
Nope. If you have alergy concerns, there are no dogs or cats in the building. There is currently a rabbit, kept upstairs in room 208.

**Can I invite someone to come stay with me?**
Nope, your host already got buy-in from other MNMT residents to host you. They will need to restart that discussion in order to allow additional people, and that can take anywhere from 24 to 48 hours.

**Is there parking?** 
Monument offers no parking. And parking in this neighborhood is difficult. There is two-hour paid parking on 9th Street until 6:30 on weekdays, free on Sunday. Never leave any valuables in your vehicle, and avoid walking alone at night.

**What do I need to bring?**
The room will have bedding and towels for you. The house has a first aid kit, but you'll want to supply all your own toiletries, hair dryer, etc. The common food is limited to snacks, please plan to supply your own meals if your host is not doing so.

**How do I get to Monument?**
Please coordinate with your host to be let into the building and oriented. Monument is 3 blocks away from the Civic Center / UN Plaza BART station. It is about 35 minutes away from SFO airport via BART, cab or Uber.

**What’s in the neighborhood?**
Lots of things are happening right around Monument. Please take precaution to be safe, especially at night. Learn more about [SoMa on AirBnb](https://www.airbnb.com/locations/san-francisco/soma)
