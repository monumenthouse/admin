#For Hosts
The guest room exists to let Monument residents host friends and family for short visits. It is not a short-term sublet. If you are looking to discuss a sublet, please talk to @Geoff on [Slack](https://mnmt.slack.com). If any of the guidelines don't make sense, or you feel you need an exception, please contact @Leslie on [Slack](https://mnmt.slack.com).

**How it works:** Add your guests stay as <Your Name> hosts <Their Name>, include arrival and departure day/times on the [Monument Guest Room calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?tab=mc#eventpage_6). 

Optionally add details about them or their stay in the description section, and/or put a note in #activities on [Slack](https://mnmt.slack.com) (where the calendar events are being surfaced). It’s first come first serve, until we deem we need another system (some other houses setup an allotment of days, for example 10, that can be traded amongst housemates).  

**It’s your responsibility to** prepare and check the room ahead of time, read through the guest room instructions (below) with the guest, and to leave the guest room ready for the next guest: launder all the bedding and towels and replace on the bed, and general cleaning of the space (sweep or vacuum). You are responsible for your guest. They should direct questions and needs towards you. If your guest is involved in any issue with other members of the house, it will be your responsibility to moderate the situation.
 
**Length of stay:** In order for this room to serve as a place for many people to swing by for a few days, and not as a crash pad for someone looking for temp housing, the stay limit is 7 days. If your guest stays for more than 7 days, they will be asked to leave, and you will need to discuss with house mates (and likely @Leslie) if you have the judgement to invite guests in the future.

**Who can stay:** Up to two guests can stay in the guest room at once under one host. (Eventually we may want to allow AirBnb guests (the average in the hood is $142/night), and it might be fun to have random visitors. At that time, someone will need to vet the guests and be their "host". When we do feel ready for that, it might make sense to only allow last minute bookings, so that house residents have first dibs with at least 2 or 4 weeks notice.)

###Host FAQ
**I’m a member, but not a resident, can I host a guest?**
If you are a member and would like to host a guest in the guest room, you need to find a resident member, who will be in town at the same time as your guest, to vouch for your guest. This is in order to make sure that someone is around as the responsible party for your guest.

**What if my guest needs to extend their stay?**
If your guest needs to extend their stay beyond 7 days, they need to find another place to stay. Airbnb.com is an excellent resource. If they are staying for fewer than 7 days, and need to extend their stay to within 7 days, and there is no one else scheduled, then simply extend the calendar event so that everyone knows the room will be occupied.


**What if there’s something not covered in these guidelines?**
This is an evolving document. Please bring your issue to the attention of @Leslie and #activities on [Slack](https://mnmt.slack.com) well before your guest arrives and all reasonable effort will be made to sort it out.
