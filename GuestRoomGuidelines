For Hosts
The guest room exists to let Monument occupants host friends and family for short visits. It is not a short-term sublet. If you are looking to discuss sublet, talk to Geoff.

How it works: Add your guests stay as <Your Name> hosts <Their Name>, include arrival and departure day/times on the calendar here: Optionally add details about them or their stay in the description section, and/or put a note in #activities on Slack (where the calendar events are being surfaced). It’s first come first serve, until we deem we need another system (some other houses setup an allotment of days, for example 10, that can be traded amongst house mates).  

It’s your responsibility to preparing and checking the room ahead of time. Read through the guest room instructions (below) with the guest. And to leave the guest ready for the next guest: Laundry of sheets/towels then replace on beds, general cleaning of space (sweep or vacuum). You are responsible for your guest. They should direct questions and needs towards you. If your guest is involved in any issue with other members of the house, it will be your responsibility to moderate the situation.
 
Length of stay: In order for this room to serve as a place for many people to swing by for a few days, and not as an option in the case of them looking for housing, or a job, the stay limit is 7 days. If your guest stays for more than 7 days, they will be asked to leave, and you will need to discuss with house mates if you have the judgement to invite guests in the future.


FAQ
I’m a member, can I host a guest?
If you are a member and would like to host a guest in the guest room, you need to find an occupant, who will be in town at the same time as your guest, to vouch for your guest. This is in order to make sure that someone is around as the responsible party for your guest.

What if my guest needs to extend their stay?
If your guest needs to extend their stay beyond 7 days, they need to find another place to stay. Airbnb.com is an excellent resource. If they are staying for fewer than 7 days, and need to extend their stay to within 7 days, and there is no one else scheduled, then simply extend the calendar event so that everyone knows the room will be occupied.
